#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To pause all ad-blocking software currently in use.** Because Bing Ads authentication uses pop ups, you may encounter issues if ad blockers aren't disabled during the setup.
  - item: |
      **To have Viewer permissions to the profiles you want to connect.** These read-only permissions will ensure Stitch can read data from the profiles you select for replication. [Read more about Bing Ads user permissions here](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52037/3/en-US/#ext:none).

  - title: "historical sync"
  - title: "replication frequency"

      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/bing-ads-select-accounts.png" alt="Selecting Bing Ads accounts." max-width="400px" %}

      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Bing account and to approve Stitch’s access to your Bing Ads data. **Note: We will only ever read your data.**
      2. Click **Authorize** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the {{ integration.display_name }} profile(s) you want to connect to Stitch.

         If you don't see the profile(s) you want to connect, verify that you have completed the [setup requirements](#setup-requirements).
      4. When selecting profiles, keep the following in mind:

         - **Selecting a subprofile will also select the parent**, or top-level profile. If you de-select the top-level profile, you will be unable to select any subprofiles.
         - **If multiple profiles are selected, data for all the selected profiles will map to the same table in your destination.** For example: If two profiles are selected and the `accounts` table is tracked, account data for both profiles will be replicated into the `accounts` table. This is applicable to every table selected in the next step.

       5. When finished selecting profiles, click **Check and Save**.
