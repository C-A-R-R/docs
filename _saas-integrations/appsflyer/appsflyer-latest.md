  - item: |
      **Access to raw data exports in {{ integration.display_name }}.** Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration uses the [Raw Data Report API](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208387843-Raw-Data-Reports-V5-) to replicate installation and in-app event data. Access to raw data is an {{ integration.display_name }} premium feature, which may only be available on their higher tiers.

      To determine if you have access to raw data pulling, [follow these instructions](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207034366-API-Policy#2-raw-data-reports-via-pull-api) in {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve the app ID"
    anchor: "retrieve-the-app-id"
    content: |
      Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

      Depending on the app's type (iOS, Android, or Windows), the app ID format will vary:

      - **iOS** - This will be the iTunes ID of your app, without the `id` portion. For example: If the app is `id987654321`, the ID would be `987654321`.
      - **Android** - This will be the package name registered on AppsFlyer. For example: If the package is registered as `com.stitchdata.test`, the ID would be `com.stitchdata.test`.
      - **Windows** - This will be the Windows app ID. For example: `f1e2d3c4b5a6`

      The location of each type of app ID is highlighted in the image below:
