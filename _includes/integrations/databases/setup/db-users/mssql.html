To bring your {{ integration.name }} data into Stitch, the system will run `SELECT` queries on your database. Initially this is done to get a snapshot of the database's structure. After the first replication job completes, you can set [Replication Methods]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for individual tables to potentially reduce your update times and the load on your server.

Creating a user with `SELECT` privileges can either be done via a query or the {{ integration.name }} UI. In this section, we'll walk you through using the query method.

{% capture us-english %}
This user's language setting must be set to `us_english`. Issues with replication may arise if a different setting is used.

1. Log into your database.
2. Create a SQL login for the Stitch database user:

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGIN [stitch_username] WITH PASSWORD=’[password]’
   go
   ```

3. Grant the Stitch user access to the database:

   ```sql
   USE [database]
   go
   ```

4. Create the Stitch database user and map them to the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER [stitch_username] FOR LOGIN 
   go
   ```

5. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges.

   To grant `SELECT` privileges to all tables in the database, run this command:

   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT to [stitch_username]
   go
   ```

   If you wish to limit the Stitch user to specific tables, run this command instead:

   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT ON [schema_name].[table_name] TO [stitch_username]
   go
   ```
