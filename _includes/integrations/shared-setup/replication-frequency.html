### Create a replication schedule {#define-rep-frequency}
{% endunless %}

In the **Replication Frequency** section, you'll create the integration's replication schedule. An integration's replication schedule determines the time that replication jobs begin.

**Note**: Replication schedules affect the time Extraction begins, not the time to data loaded. Refer to the [Replication Scheduling]({{ link.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}) documentation for more information.

How you create a replication schedule depends on your needs:

- **To kick off replication jobs every minute or 30 minutes**, use the [Replication Frequency]({{ link.replication.rep-frequency | prepend: site.baseurl }}) setting.
- **To kick off replication jobs at specific intervals of an hour or more**, use [Anchor Scheduling]({{ link.replication.anchor-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Anchor scheduling is a combination of Replication Frequency and Anchor Time.

To help prevent overages, consider setting the integration to replicate less frequently. See the [Understanding and Reducing Your Row Usage guide]({{ link.billing.billing-guide | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for tips on reducing your usage.

<!-- Only display if integration enforces API limits -->

**{{ integration.display_name }} API Limits & Replication Frequency**<br>
{{ integration.display_name }}'s API enforces usage limits. As a result, a high Replication Frequency may exceed these limits and impact Stitch's ability to replicate data. See the [Replication](#replication) section below for more details.
