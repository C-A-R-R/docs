### Initial and historical replication jobs {#initial-sync}

After you finish setting up {{ integration.display_name }}, its **Sync Status** may show as **Pending** on either the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} or in the {{ app.page-names.int-details }} page.

A **Pending** status indicates that Stitch is in the process of scheduling the initial replication job for the integration. **This may take some time to complete.**

#### Free historical data loads

The first seven days of replication for a new integration are free. Rows replicated from the new integration during this time won't count towards your quota. Stitch offers this as a way of testing new integrations, measuring usage, and ensuring historical data volumes don't quickly consume your quota.

{% include note.html content="**Replication will continue after the seven days are over**. If you're no longer interested in this source, be sure to **pause** or **delete** the integration to prevent unwanted usage." %}
