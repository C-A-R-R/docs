### {{ integration.display_name }}'s Intial Replication Job {#initial-sync}

After you finish setting up {{ integration.display_name }}, you might see its **Sync Status** show as Pending on either the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} or in the {{ app.page-names.int-details }} page.

For a new integration, a **Pending** status indicates that Stitch is in the process of scheduling the initial replication job for the integration. This may take some time to complete.
