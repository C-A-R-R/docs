## Extracting Data from {{ integration.display_name }} {#extract-data}

When you connect a database as an input, Stitch only needs read-only access to the databases, {{ object }}s, and {{ col }}s you want to replicate. There are two processes Stitch runs during the Extraction phase of the replication process: a **structure sync** and a **data sync**.

### Structure Sync

The first part of the replication process is called a **structure sync**. This process will detect any changes to the structure of your database. For example: a new {{ col }} is added to one of the {{ object }}s you’re syncing in Stitch.

{% assign extraction = site.data.taps.extraction.database-queries %}


{% if integration.db-type == "rds" %}
<table class="table-hover">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span" width="25%; fixed" align="right">
                **Database Type**
            </td>
            <td markdown="span">
                **Structure Sync Queries**
            </td>
        </tr>
        {% for database in extraction.all-types %}
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span" align="right">
                **{{ database.name }}**
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ extraction[database.type].structure-sync | markdownify }}
            </td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>

{% else %}

{{ extraction[integration.db-type].structure-sync | flatify | markdownify }}

{% endif %}

### Data Sync

The second step in the Extraction phase is called a **data sync**. This is where Stitch "extracts" data and replicates it. {% if integration.db-type != "mongo" %}The method Stitch uses is the same for all databases, but differs depending on the Replication Method that each {{ object }} uses.{% endif %}

#### Full Table Replication

For tables using Full Table Replication, Stitch will run a single query and read out of the resulting cursor in batches:

{{ extraction.data-sync-queries.full-table | markdownify }}

#### Incremental Replication

For tables using Incremental Replication, Stitch will run a single query and read out of the associated cursor in batches:

{{ extraction.data-sync-queries.incremental | markdownify }}


### Recommendations

While we make every effort to ensure the queries that Stitch runs don’t impart significant load on your databases, we still have some recommendations for guaranteeing database performance:

- **Use a replica database instead of connecting directly**. We recommend using read replicas in lieu of directly connecting production databases with high availability and performance requirements.
- **Apply indexes to [Replication Key]({{ rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) columns**. We restrict and order our replication queries by this {{ col }}, so applying an index to the {{ col }}s you’re using as Replication Keys can improve performance. {% if integration.db-type == "mongo" %}**Indexes are required to use Mongo fields as Replication Keys**.{% endif %}
