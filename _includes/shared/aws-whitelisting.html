1. The Security Group associated with your {{ destination.display_name }} instance should automatically open in the Security Groups page. If it doesn't, click the name of the appropriate group.
2. The Security Group's details will display in tabs in the bottom part of the page. Click the **Inbound** tab:

3. In the Inbound tab, click the **Edit** button. This will open the **Edit inbound rules** window.
4. This is where youâ€™ll add the IP addresses that can access the instance. Fill out the fields in this screen as follows:
   - **Type:** Select **Custom TCP Rule** from the drop-down.
   - **Protocol:** This will default to **TCP** - leave it as-is.
   - **Port Range:** Enter the port associated with the instance. This will be the same port you used to create the instance. (`{{ destination.port }}` is the default)
   - **Source:** The drop-down will default to **Custom** - leave it as-is. 

      In the field next to the drop-down, copy and paste one of the following IP addresses. You need to add them one at a time, meaning each IP address gets its own rule:

      {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
      - {{ ip-address.ip }}
      {% endfor %}

      Below is an example of what a rule should look like:

5. Click **Add Rule** to add an additional Inbound rule.
6. Repeat the previous two steps until all of Stitch's IP addresses (along with any others you may want to whitelist) have been added.
7. Click **Save**.
