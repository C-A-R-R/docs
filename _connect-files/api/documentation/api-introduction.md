      The {{ page.api-name }} can be used to:

        - Create Stitch client accounts,
        - Access existing Stitch client accounts, and
        - Configure source and destination connections within those clients' accounts

      The {{ page.api-name }} is organized around REST and uses resource-oriented URLs to promote usability. Each endpoint uses standard HTTP verbs like `GET` and `POST`, and we will return [standard HTTP response codes](#response-codes) to indicate request status or errors.

      We built the {{ page.api-name }} to accept and return [JSON](http://json.org) in all responses, including errors.
