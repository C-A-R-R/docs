## How does it work? {#how-it-works}

Create your custom referral link by inserting the email address associated with your Stitch account into this URL:

```
get.stitchdata.com/referrals?referrer_email=YOUR_EMAIL_HERE
```

Then have your friends sign up using your custom referral link. Once they start replicating data, both you and your friend will be credited with an extra 1 million rows per month for free.

## How will I know I've earned free rows? {#earned-free-rows}

Once your friend starts replicating data, weâ€™ll credit your account and send you an email.

---

## Are there any limitations? {#limitations}
Nope! There is no limit on the number of rows you can earn, and they will be automatically applied to your account every month.
