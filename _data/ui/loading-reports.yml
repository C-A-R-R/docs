      The highest [Replication Bookmark]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) Key value Stitch has loaded to your destination for the table, displayed as `column_name: value`.

      For database integrations, this is the column selected when the table's [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is defined. Stitch automatically selects Replication Keys for SaaS integrations.

      Keep in mind that:

      - Replication Bookmark columns can be timestamps, integers, or date-time fields. 
      - If the table is currently being loaded, some data may load out of order.
