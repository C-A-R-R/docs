      The highest [Replication Bookmark Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) value Stitch has loaded to your destination for the table, displayed as `column_name: value`.

      **On the drilldown page**, this will be the highest Replication Bookmark Key value Stitch has loaded to your destination for that particular replication job.

      For database integrations, this is the column selected when the table's [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is defined. Stitch automatically selects Replication Keys for SaaS integrations.

      Keep in mind that:

      - Replication Bookmark columns can be timestamps, integers, or date-time fields. 
      - If the table is currently being loaded, some data may load out of order.
