    default-streams: |
      Sets the default selections for the data structures (tables) to be replicated during the source integration setup. Should be an object of the form `{"table_name": true}`.

      Only top-level tables can be provided - nesting is not currently supported.

      **Note**: If a table name is provided that isn't provided by the source integration, it is ignored. Values other than `true` are also ignored.
      
    ephemeral-token: "A token that is passed to [Stitch.js]({{ js.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to create a session."

    ephemeral-token-js: "The token used to automatically log the user into the Stitch client account. Retrieved by creating a session using the [Create a Session endpoint]({{ api.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl | append: api.core-objects.sessions.create.anchor }})."

  ## Databases & Destinations

    host: "The IP address or hostname of the database server."

    port: "The port of the database server."

    database: "The name of the logical database to connect to."

    name: |
      The name of the source connection, dynamically generated from `display_name`. The `name` corresponds to the destination schema name that the data from this source will be loaded into.
