#      Server Settings       #
# -------------------------- #

## The required server settings for a MySQL server, and their required values.

server-settings:
  - name: "binlog_format"
    value: "ROW"
    description: |
      Defines the binary logging format. A `ROW` value enables "event-based" capture, which describes what happens to records in the database. **This is necessary to use binlog.**

      Stitch supports the following event types:

      - `INSERT`
      - `UPDATE`
      - `DELETE`

      **Setting the value of this variable requires the [`SUPER`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) privilege.**

  - name: "binlog_row_image"
    value: "FULL"
    description: |
      Defines how row images are written to the binary log. A `FULL` value ensures that all columns in a row are logged in the before and after images of a change, enabling Stitch to accurately capture all changes made to a record.

  - name: "expire_logs_days"
    value: "7"
    description: &log-retention-desc |
      Specifies the amount of time, in days, before the automatic removal of binary log files. Stitch recommends a retention period of **7 days**, but a minimum of **3 days** will also work.

      Do not use both `expire_logs_days` and `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` - only define one. The value of this variable will be ignored if `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` also contains a value.

      **Note**: This variable is deprecated as of MySQL version 8.0.3, and will be removed in a future release. If using MySQL versions 8.0.1+, use `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` instead.

  - name: "binlog_expire_logs_seconds"
    value: "604800"
    description: |
      Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, before the automatic removal of binary log files. Stitch recommends a retention period of **7 days**, but a minimum of **3 days** will also work.

      **Note**: This variable is available on MySQL versions 8.0.1+.

  - name: "log_bin"
    value: "ON"
    description: |
      Turns on the ability to use binlog on the server.

# -------------------------- #
#  Database User Privileges  #
# -------------------------- #

## The permissions Stitch needs to connect to and replicate data from a MySQL database.

user-privileges:
  - name: "SELECT"
    reason: "Required to select rows from tables in a database."
    doc-link: |
      https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select

  - name: "REPLICATION CLIENT"
    reason: |
      **Required for binlog replication.** Required to use [`SHOW BINARY LOGS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-binary-logs.html), which determines that a binary log exists.
    doc-link: |
      https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client

  - name: "REPLICATION SLAVE"
    reason: |
      **Required for binlog replication.** Required to use [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-binary-logs.html), which fetches the current binlog file and position on the server.
