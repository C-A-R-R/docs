# -------------------------- #

## The required server settings for a MySQL server, and their required values.

defaults:
  names:
    binlog-format: &binlog-format-name "binlog_format"
    binlog-row-image: &binlog-row-image-name "binlog_row_image"
    expire-logs-days: &expire-logs-days-name "expire_logs_days"
    binlog-expire-logs-seconds: &binlog-expire-logs-seconds-name "binlog_expire_logs_seconds"

  values:
    binlog-format: &binlog-format-value "ROW"
    binlog-row-image: &binlog-row-image-value "FULL"
    expire-logs-days: &expire-logs-days-value "7"
    binlog-expire-logs-seconds: &binlog-expire-logs-seconds-value "604800"

  descriptions:
    binlog-format: &binlog-format-description |
      Defines the binary logging format. A `ROW` value enables "event-based" capture, which describes what happens to records in the database. **This is necessary to use binlog.**

        Stitch supports the following event types:

        - `INSERT`
        - `UPDATE`
        - `DELETE`

    binlog-row-image: &binlog-row-image-description |
      Defines how row images are written to the binary log. A `FULL` value ensures that all columns in a row are logged in the before and after images of a change, enabling Stitch to accurately capture all changes made to a record.

    expire-logs-days: &expire-logs-days-description |
      Specifies the amount of time, in days, before the automatic removal of binary log files. Stitch recommends a retention period of **7 days**, but a minimum of **3 days** will also work.

      Do not use both `expire_logs_days` and `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` - only define one. The value of this variable will be ignored if `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` also contains a value.

      **Note**: This variable is deprecated as of MySQL version 8.0.3, and will be removed in a future release. If using MySQL versions 8.0.1+, use `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` instead.

    binlog-expire-logs-seconds: &binlog-expire-logs-seconds-description |
      Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, before the automatic removal of binary log files. Stitch recommends a retention period of **7 days**, but a minimum of **3 days** will also work.

      **Note**: This variable is available on MySQL versions 8.0.1+.

#  Database User Privileges  #
# -------------------------- #

## The permissions Stitch needs to connect to and replicate data from a MySQL database.

user-privileges:
  - name: "SELECT"
    reason: "Required to select rows from tables in a database."
    doc-link: |
      https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select

  - name: "REPLICATION CLIENT"
    reason: |
      **Required for binlog replication.** Required to use [`SHOW BINARY LOGS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-binary-logs.html), which determines that a binary log exists.

  - name: "REPLICATION SLAVE"
    reason: |
      **Required for binlog replication.** Required to use [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-binary-logs.html), which fetches the current binlog file and position on the server.
