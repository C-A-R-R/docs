#      General Tooltips      #
# -------------------------- #

analysis-integration: “Analysis integrations are third-party tools you can layer on top of your data warehouse to query, visualize, and otherwise explore your data.”

api-quota: "An API quota refers to the total number of API requests that can be made in a given period of time."

api-rate-limit: "An API's rate limit refers to how often requests can be made in a given period of time. "

append-only-rep: "Append-Only Replication is a type of Incremental Replication where newly replicated data is appended to the end of a table. Existing rows are not updated - any updates will be added to the table as new rows."

certified-integration: "Certified integrations will receive commercial support, which is a guarantee that Stitch will fix bugs and adapt to new versions of third-party APIs."

community-integration: "Maintenance of Community integrations will be performed by the Singer community. This includes fixing bugs and adapting to new versions of third-party APIs."

database-integration: “Database integrations are just that - databases. This includes MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and others.”

destination: “Destination is our word for ‘data warehouse.’ A data warehouse is a central repository for data accumulated from a variety of sources.”

full-table-rep: "Full Table Replication means that ALL rows in a table - including new, updated, and existing - will be replicated during every replication attempt."

historical-sync: "Historical syncs are how far back from the Stitch connection date, by default, Stitch will fetch historical data."

incremental-rep: "Incremental Replication means that only new or updated data will be replicated during a replication attempt."

primary-key: "Primary Keys are used to identify unique rows within a table and ensure that only the most recently updated version of that record appears in your data warehouse."

replication-frequency: "Replication Frequency refers to how often - based on the time of the last completed attempt - Stitch will attempt to replicate data from a data source."

replication-key: "Replication Keys are columns used to identify new and updated data for replication. These are typically integer, datetime, or timestamp columns."

row-count: "A replicated row is any row that moves through Stitch, whether it's a new addition, updated record, or a copy of an updated record. This includes rows in nested subtables."

saas-integration: “SaaS integrations are cloud-based third-party services like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Trello.”

updated-at-rep: "Updated or Modified At is a type of Incremental Replication that uses datetime or timestamp columns to detect new and updated data."

whitelisting-feature: "Whitelisting is a feature that allows you to select specific tables and columns for replication."
